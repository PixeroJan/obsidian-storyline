# StoryLine — Changelog

---

## Version 1.3.0

> **⚠️ Important — Back up your StoryLine folder before updating!**
>
> This release includes a one-time automatic migration that moves per-project settings out of the shared `data.json` file and into individual `System/` files inside each project folder. This is a necessary change to make StoryLine work reliably across multiple devices (desktop, mobile, sync services).
>
> The migration runs automatically on first launch and should be seamless, but as a precaution, **please make a copy of your entire `StoryLine/` folder** before installing version 1.3.0 — just in case something goes wrong.

### New Features

- **Corkboard View** — A new freeform corkboard layout in the Board view. Use sticky notes to brainstorm and capture your first ideas, then convert them into scenes when they're ready. Notes can be styled with different colors and support markdown. Pin notes and scene cards anywhere on a spatial canvas and drag them to rearrange. Toggle between the standard column layout Kanban and corkboard mode with a single click. Positions are saved per project.

- **DOCX Export** — Export your manuscript or outline as a `.docx` Word document, ready for editors, agents, or print formatting. Includes its own settings for page size, margins, font, and header styles. Works also on mobile.

- **PDF Export** — Export your project directly to PDF with styled formatting and section headers. Works on desktop via the built-in print engine. PDF export only works on desktop.

- **HTML Export** — Full HTML export with embedded styles for sharing or archiving your project as a standalone web page.

- **Browse for Project** — A new "Browse for Project…" button in the project selector lets you manually find and open any StoryLine project in your vault, including deeply nested series projects. Useful when projects aren't detected automatically (e.g. on mobile or after a fresh sync).

### Improvements

- **System file architecture** — Per-project data (tag colors, character aliases, plotgrid layout, corkboard positions, writing tracker history, filter presets) is now stored in `System/` JSON files inside each project folder instead of the shared plugin `data.json`. This eliminates sync conflicts when working across multiple devices and keeps project data portable.

- **Automatic migration** — On first launch, existing per-project data is automatically migrated from `data.json` to the new `System/` files. No manual steps required.

- **Project detection retry** — If no projects are found on startup (common on mobile where the file system may load slowly), StoryLine now retries up to three times with increasing delays before showing the project selector.

- **Recursive project scanning** — Project detection now scans subfolders recursively, so series projects nested several levels deep (e.g. `StoryLine/My Series/Book 1/Book 1.md`) are found automatically.

- **Default view setting** — Choose which view opens by default when launching StoryLine. Set your preferred starting view (Board, Timeline, Characters, etc.) in the plugin settings.

### Bug Fixes

- **Dropdown background fix** — Fixed a visual bug where dropdown menus (status, POV, filters) had transparent or incorrectly themed backgrounds, making them hard to read in certain themes.

- **Corkboard positions no longer stored in frontmatter** — Board positions are now saved in `System/board.json` instead of the project file's YAML frontmatter, preventing unnecessary file changes and sync noise.

- **Feature flags preserved during migration** — Global settings like series mode and export toggles are no longer accidentally removed when migrating per-project data.

- **Migration timing fix** — Resolved a race condition where settings could be saved before migration data was fully loaded into memory, which previously caused tag overrides and other project data to be lost.
